                <p>“Due to my job, we have moved to multiple states around the country. MACS by far has been our favorite gym that my daughter has ever been to. She has not only grown as an individual, but the friends and relationships she has made are amazing.  The owners and coaches are by far the best we have experienced. Macs isn’t just where my daughter cheers but they are family!!”</p>

                <h2>Jenn Germer</h2>
                <p>"My daughter has cheered at MACS for 8 years. I am grateful every day for the decision I made to bring her here. They have taught her resiliency,, strength, the amazing value of being a good teammate, confidence, loyalty, and given her a love for the sport of cheerleading that she will take with her throughout her life.
                    The coaches at this gym, are family to her and to all of us. We are so grateful for the opportunities that have been given to her because of Mack, Janet and the rest of their incredible staff.
                    The work ethic and values my daughter has learned while being an athlete here will help her immensely as she moves forward in life. WE LOVE OUR MACS FAMILY FOREVER."</p>

                <h2>Brady Petit</h2>
                <p>“We were skeptical about joining Macs because of some rumors. We are so glad we decided to see for ourselves. Coaches dedicate so much time & effort to their athletes.  Respect for all is heavily encouraged & even required.  Bonding activities help the teams learn how to work better  together.  Coaches provide feedback appropriately (not demeaning). We are so glad we found Macs. So many amazing coaches & athletes, you won’t ever ‘cap out’ there!”</p>

                <p>“MACS has been our family's second home for six years now. It's a place where both of my daughters thrive, surrounded by positive role models. The opportunity to travel the country with their best friends and pursue their passion has made MACS truly exceptional. The invaluable life lessons from victories and defeats have shaped them into resilient team players, encouraged by the unwavering support and love of their coaches. Being a part of the MACS Family is something we cherish beyond words.”</p>

                <p>"This is our 3rd season with Macs Cheer. It is hard work and a huge commitment to compete at this level. This is an amazing program that turns out world class athletes. I know all the coaches care about my kid and have worked with her individually to help her improve. She has received positive feedback from the owners. Macs is a family. We support all our teams and root for friends on other teams too. I watched my daughter cheer for her competition last weekend. Hard work & good sportsmanship is part of this culture. We love MACS!"</p>
