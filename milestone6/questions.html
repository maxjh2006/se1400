                <p>All star cheer is a sport defined by three things, stunting, tumbling, and performing. We teach discipline, leaderhsip, and all of these aforementioned skills in order to build a bond between teamates; strength, and dedication in all. We compete locally and nationally several times each season, which cycles every 11 months, making this a year round sport. It takes a lot of time and effort, but is worth your every minute.</p>
