        <h1>Our Audience</h1>
        <p>There will be a number of different people from all walks of life coming to our page, and I want to appeal to them all, and create the best, most professional and appealing website that I possibly can.</p>

        <h4>Geolocation</h4>
        <p>Our primary audience will be located, ideally, all around the country, but realisticaly, along the western United States.
            Being located in Utah, a large portion of web traffic should be coming from there, as we advertise and use word of mouth, we would hope to 
            have curious folks look us up online, accessing our website. Another possiblity is people from the west coast, as we compete frequently against competitiors
            from California, Nevada, Arizona, and Idaho, people may search up our program to see what they are up against, as well as people that are moving from those areas 
            checking out what sorts of gyms they might be moving near to, deciding which to choose can be influnced heavily by media like websites.
        </p>

        <h4>Age</h4>
        <p>The age of people accessing our website could be varying, as child athletes might use their parents computers to find the team they are up against,
            or see what other gyms are in Utah. However, the majority of people accessing the website will be parents, I would say between 27-37 years old, at this range, I assume
            that this demographic is the most common age for parents to be looking at gyms, as that is where people are moving, and where kids are becoming the age where they can start cheer,
            whether that is 5 years old or 15, I would guess that this age group is the type that would be looking on google and social media to see what will be
            the best for their children.
        </p>

        <h4>Gender</h4>
        <p>Cheerleading in general, especially in all star is dominated by female athletes, and moms are often the 'cheer parent' as the dads are much less interested and will just watch
            without really knowing what is going on. There are absolutely some great cheer dads out there, but the moms dominate the scene. For that reason I know that females would make up a
            majority of website vists, as they want the best for their kid, and are often the ex-cheerleader or gymnast in the family.
        </p>

        <h4>Other</h4>
        <p>Some other demographics of our users would have to be parents, most people that do not have kids are not going to be looking up our gym, and coaches from other gyms likely already have information
            about us from word of mouth and experiences in person. They would most of the time already be involved in cheer in some way, whether that is current athletes, ex-athletes, or those
            with friends or family already in a program. Most cheer people have some sort of connection already, and majority of advertisement is just word of mouth.
