        <h1>Our Competition</h1>
        <p>Most other gyms have websites as well, here I am going to discuss some of the good and some of the aspects that need improvement to help make my own website the best that it can be.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Rival Athletics</h3>
        <p>Rival Athletics has a website that has clearly been updated recently, and is a ver solid one that I will need to take inspiration from. It opens up with a compalition of videos that grab your attention.
            The theme of the website is maroon and white which is easy to read and fits their gyms colors, there is a lot of different links and pages that are mostly all useful. The layout is pretty easy to understand and I like the way that it is smooth and easy to follow.
            Some of the downsides is that there is a lot of information, some of which is on there multiple times, that can be good as it creates an emphasis on that stuff, but it does show up a lot. 
            It is a big website and so there are a lot of links and pages so there is sometimes where you might find yoursefl struggling to find the correct place.
        </p>

        <h3>Fusion All Stars</h3>
        <p>Fusion's website is very simple, clean and easy to follow. It starts off with the links right up top so you can find right where you want to go. They are not trying to over do it and that is good. One thing
            that I really like is they have a testimonials page, which has detailed reasons from parents of athletes to why they love this gym and all of the good that has came from it. If someone is trying to pick a gym that is a section they would definetly want to look at.
            The website is simple, but in some ways, it looks a little too simple, a little home made. It is not sloppy but I think some of the design choices could have been better, and having the highest quality proffesional pictues can add a very different feel
            compared to those taken on a phone camera on a casual environment, it can change the mood and feel of the website, but that just depends of preference. It does not look too personalized and somewhat looks like a template was stricly followed and used to make the website.
        </p>

        <h3>Utah Extreme Cheer</h3>
        <p>This website is an interesting one, the colors are good, and it has some fonts that fit the vibe, but are kind of hard to read, that something I very strongly wish to avoid. There are some pictures right up front on the website that cycle through and show the gym,
            however they are not the highest quality of image, and they move quite fast which I found to be a little bit headache inducing. I liked the black and blue, high contrast font at the botttom of the Page,
            it was on theme and easy to read. One of the pages has a quote from the owner and a collage showing the athletes competing and having fun, I enjoyed that detail a lot, a personal, fun page showing what the gym is all about is a great addition.
        </p>

        <h3>Cheer Athletics</h3>
        <p>This is not directly competition, as there are no cheer athletics locations in utah, however, this website is a great example of a professional and well made gym website. Cheer athletics is a massive, well known franchise, and the professional looking website does a great job 
            enveloping what they stand for. There is images, but they are more subtle and fit the links they are next to, I like the themed colors and images, clothing next to the pro shop, chamption banners near the 'about us' and high quaily images that are links to certain areas, dance, cheer, and camps.
            The focus of this website is to show some overall success but then pushes you to choose the location desired in order to get specific information, this is good because each one is different, has different staff and athletes.
            Overall there is not really anything wrong with this website, and I think I will use it for inspirations and I will add a page about our own pro shop, where we sell merchandise.
        </p>

        <h4>How I Will do Better</h4>
        <p>I will use all of the good aspects of these websites, and use them to create the most balanced, readable, interactive, and concsise website that I can to create a successful result. I will think about all the bad things from these, and do my best to avoid making those same mistakes.
            I plan to make a clean website, without too much information, especially on the first page, using high quality images, and groupings and videos to show what Mac's is all about. It will not be too much, but it will be just the right amount of information and links to give the most information and interest that I can.
