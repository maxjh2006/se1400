        <h2>Website Summary</h2>
        <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
        <p>My site will contain all sorts of information around Mac's Cheer, the gym that I cheer at.
            I cheer there and I recently looked at our online website and it is outdated and sloppy.
            My site will contain a fresh new look, containing details about contact, teams, camps, gym hours and
            location,
            general information, forms and other general neccesary links and details about the gym
        </p>

        <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site?</h4>
        <p>The content for my website will come from a number of places. I will talk to some of the coaches,
            or even the owners if I am unsure about information, I will use what I know to help fill in and what is on
            the website right now. I can find videos on youtube as well as images from my own phone, social media,
            varsity
            (the company that hosts competitions and whatnot), and things from coaches and other athletes.
        </p>

        <h4>Why shoud users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
        <p>Users should care about my website because they can learn why they should choose Mac's, they can see what
            makes the gym so amazing, and it will help kids find a hobby they can enjoy. It will also educate others on
            the nature of our gym, the sport, and some cool things that we do. It can be accessed by people outside of
            Utah
            who just want to learn about our gym as it is becoming more well known and watched across the country.
        </p>

        <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
        <p>A site needs to be built for this to help gather attention, it can help parents of athletes currently
            attending Mac's, or those looking for a new gym or new sport, it can make it easier for parents to find
            information
            about pay, contact, and teams or camps. This will help things to run smoother and potentially take some work
            load away from the owners and coaches. It will create a better experience for those interested in our
            program.
        </p>

        <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
        <p>I would like users to learn about our gym, why we are different, and what makes us so great. I want to
            introduce the staff
            as well as the teams and athletes, I want people to be able to explore and find out new information. I also
            want it to exist
            to help make parents lives easier, to help them contact the gym with questions, to find relase forms, and to
            answer frequently
            asked questions. This website should answer questions and provoke intrigue, It should create interest.
        </p>

        <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
        <p>The goal of the site is to answer questions, to make life easier for parents, athletes, and coaches. The site
            should
            interact with users and show them why our gym is so good, it should help advertise and get people interested
            in joining.
            It should help get attention and make our program look just that much more professional and trustworthy, a
            nice website
            can really go a long way, and having an outdated one is a look that should be avoided if possible. This can
            really help
            the gym look better and have a more welcoming feel.
